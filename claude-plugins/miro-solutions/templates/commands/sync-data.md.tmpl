# Sync {{DATA_SOURCE}} Data to Miro

Pull data from {{DATA_SOURCE}} and visualize it on a Miro board.

## Arguments

Parse the user's input to extract:
1. **board-url** (required): Miro board URL
2. **query** (optional): Filter or query for the data (e.g., project name, date range)

## Workflow

1. If board URL is missing, ask the user for it
2. Connect to {{DATA_SOURCE}} using the configured MCP
3. Fetch data based on the query (or get recent/relevant items)
4. Determine the best visualization:
   - **Table** - For structured list data (issues, records, items)
   - **Diagram** - For relational data (dependencies, hierarchies)
   - **Cards** - For individual work items with metadata
5. Create the visualization on the Miro board
6. Report what was synced with a link to the board

## Data Mapping

Map {{DATA_SOURCE}} fields to Miro content:

| {{DATA_SOURCE}} Field | Miro Representation |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Title/Name | Card title or table column |
| Status | Select column with color coding |
| Assignee | Text column |
| Priority | Select column with colors |
| Description | Card description or document |
| Dates | Text column |

## Examples

**Sync recent items:**
```
/{{CUSTOMER_SLUG}}:sync https://miro.com/app/board/abc=
```
→ Syncs recent items from {{DATA_SOURCE}} to the board

**Sync with filter:**
```
/{{CUSTOMER_SLUG}}:sync https://miro.com/app/board/abc= project:alpha
```
→ Syncs items matching the filter

## Error Handling

- If {{DATA_SOURCE}} credentials not configured, guide user to set them up
- If no data matches the query, report this clearly
- If board URL is invalid, ask for a valid URL

## Tips

- For large datasets, consider filtering to recent or high-priority items
- Use frames to organize synced data on the board
- Set up regular syncs by saving the board URL
