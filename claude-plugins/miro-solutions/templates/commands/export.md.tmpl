# Export Miro Content to {{DATA_SOURCE}}

Extract content from a Miro board and push it to {{DATA_SOURCE}}.

## Arguments

Parse the user's input to extract:
1. **board-url** (required): Miro board URL (can include frame focus)
2. **target** (optional): Specific destination in {{DATA_SOURCE}} (e.g., project, folder)

## Exportable Content

| Miro Content | {{DATA_SOURCE}} Destination |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| Cards | Issues/Tasks |
| Table rows | Records/Items |
| Sticky notes | Comments/Notes |
| Documents | Documentation |
| Diagrams | Attachments/Images |

## Workflow

1. If board URL is missing, ask the user for it
2. Read board content using Miro MCP tools:
   - `miro__board_get_items` to list items
   - `miro__context_get_board_docs` for structured extraction
   - `miro__table_list_rows` for table data
3. Transform content to {{DATA_SOURCE}} format
4. Push to {{DATA_SOURCE}} using its MCP
5. Report what was exported with links to created items

## Examples

**Export entire board:**
```
/{{CUSTOMER_SLUG}}:export https://miro.com/app/board/abc=
```
→ Exports all exportable content from the board

**Export specific frame:**
```
/{{CUSTOMER_SLUG}}:export https://miro.com/app/board/abc=/?moveToWidget=123
```
→ Exports content from the focused frame only

**Export to specific destination:**
```
/{{CUSTOMER_SLUG}}:export https://miro.com/app/board/abc= project:beta
```
→ Exports to the specified project/folder in {{DATA_SOURCE}}

## Content Transformation

### Cards to Issues
```
Miro Card:
- Title: "Implement login"
- Description: "Add OAuth support"
- Tags: ["priority:high", "sprint:1"]

{{DATA_SOURCE}} Issue:
- Title: "Implement login"
- Description: "Add OAuth support"
- Priority: High
- Sprint: 1
```

### Tables to Records
```
Miro Table Row:
| Task | Status | Assignee |
| Fix bug | Done | Alice |

{{DATA_SOURCE}} Record:
- Task: "Fix bug"
- Status: "Done"
- Assignee: "Alice"
```

### Documents to Docs
```
Miro Document:
# Sprint Goals
- Complete auth module
- Fix critical bugs

{{DATA_SOURCE}} Doc:
Title: "Sprint Goals"
Content: (formatted markdown)
```

## Duplicate Handling

- Check for existing items before creating
- Update existing items if found (match by title or ID)
- Report created vs. updated counts

## Error Handling

- If {{DATA_SOURCE}} credentials not configured, guide user to set them up
- If board is empty or has no exportable content, report clearly
- If export fails for specific items, continue with others and report failures

## Tips

- Use frame-focused URLs to export specific sections
- Filter by item type if you only want certain content
- Review board content before export to ensure data quality
