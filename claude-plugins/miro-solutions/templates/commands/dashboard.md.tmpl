# Create Dashboard from {{DATA_SOURCE}}

Build a visual dashboard on a Miro board using data from {{DATA_SOURCE}}.

## Arguments

Parse the user's input to extract:
1. **board-url** (required): Miro board URL
2. **dashboard-type** (optional): Type of dashboard to create

## Dashboard Types

| Type | Components | Best For |
|------|------------|----------|
| **overview** | Key metrics, status summary, recent items | Executive updates |
| **project** | Task breakdown, timeline, blockers | Project management |
| **sprint** | Velocity, burndown data, sprint goals | Agile teams |
| **team** | Workload, assignments, availability | Resource planning |
| **custom** | User-specified components | Specific needs |

## Workflow

1. If board URL is missing, ask the user for it
2. Determine dashboard type (auto-detect or use specified)
3. Fetch relevant data from {{DATA_SOURCE}}
4. Create dashboard layout on Miro:
   - Create containing frame for the dashboard
   - Add header with title and date
   - Create component frames for each section
   - Populate with tables, diagrams, and text
5. Report success with board link

## Dashboard Layout

```
+------------------------------------------+
|          {{CUSTOMER_NAME}} Dashboard     |
|          Updated: {date}                 |
+------------------------------------------+
|                    |                     |
|   Key Metrics      |   Status Summary    |
|   (text/numbers)   |   (diagram/chart)   |
|                    |                     |
+--------------------+---------------------+
|                    |                     |
|   Recent Items     |   Action Items      |
|   (table)          |   (cards/stickies)  |
|                    |                     |
+--------------------+---------------------+
```

## Examples

**Auto-detect dashboard:**
```
/{{CUSTOMER_SLUG}}:dashboard https://miro.com/app/board/abc=
```
→ Creates overview dashboard based on available data

**Specific dashboard:**
```
/{{CUSTOMER_SLUG}}:dashboard https://miro.com/app/board/abc= project
```
→ Creates project-focused dashboard

**Custom dashboard:**
```
/{{CUSTOMER_SLUG}}:dashboard https://miro.com/app/board/abc= custom "show tasks by assignee and blocked items"
```
→ Creates custom dashboard with specified components

## Components

### Key Metrics (Text/Numbers)
```
+------------------+
| Open Issues: 42  |
| Completed: 128   |
| In Progress: 15  |
+------------------+
```

### Status Summary (Diagram)
```
Flowchart showing:
To Do (12) -> In Progress (15) -> Review (8) -> Done (128)
```

### Recent Items (Table)
| Item | Status | Assignee | Updated |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| Task 1 | In Progress | Alice | 2h ago |
| Task 2 | Review | Bob | 1d ago |

### Action Items (Cards)
Sticky notes or cards for items needing attention:
- Blocked items
- Overdue tasks
- Unassigned high-priority items

## Refresh Strategy

Dashboards can be refreshed by re-running the command:
- New data updates existing components
- Layout is preserved
- Historical data is archived in a separate frame

## Tips

- Create dashboards in dedicated frames for easy navigation
- Use consistent color coding across components
- Add a legend for status colors
- Include data timestamp for freshness awareness
- Link to detailed views for drill-down
