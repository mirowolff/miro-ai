```
/{{CUSTOMER_SLUG}}:sync https://miro.com/app/board/your-board-id=
```

```

### Export from Miro
```
/{{CUSTOMER_SLUG}}:export https://miro.com/app/board/your-board-id=
```

## Customization

### Adding New Commands

Create new `.md` files in the `commands/` directory following the existing patterns.

### Modifying Data Mappings

Edit the command files to adjust how data is transformed between Miro and your systems.

### Adding Data Sources

1. Research the MCP server for your tool
2. Add configuration to `.mcp.json`
3. Create commands that use the new MCP

## Troubleshooting

### Credentials Not Found
Ensure environment variables are set correctly. Check with:
```bash
echo $MIRO_OAUTH_TOKEN
```

### Plugin Not Loading
Ensure you're using the correct path:
```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./{{CUSTOMER_SLUG}}-miro-plugin
```

### Miro Tools Not Available
Ensure the `miro` plugin is installed. It provides all Miro MCP tools.

### Board Access Denied
Ensure the Miro OAuth token has access to the board you're trying to use.
