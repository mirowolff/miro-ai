# Enterprise Use Cases for Miro

Common patterns for enterprise Miro adoption across industries and functions.

## 1. Design Handoff

**Challenge:** Design-to-development handoff causes delays, miscommunication, and rework.

**Miro Solution:**
```
Flow: Miro wireframes -> Miro Specs -> AI coding tools -> Code
```

**Implementation:**
1. Designers create wireframes with annotations in Miro
2. PMs add requirements as text/stickies near designs
3. Generate Miro Spec from the frame
4. Developer imports spec into coding assistant
5. AI generates component scaffolding
6. Human refines and ships

**Value:** 40-60% reduction in back-and-forth between design and engineering.

## 2. Sprint Planning

**Challenge:** Sprint planning is scattered across multiple tools with no visual overview.

**Miro Solution:**
```
Flow: Backlog on Miro board -> Cluster and prioritize -> Sync to Jira/Linear
```

**Implementation:**
1. Import backlog items as cards on Miro board
2. Team clusters and prioritizes visually
3. Estimate with voting/pointing features
4. Sync selected items back to Jira/Linear
5. Track progress with synced app cards

**Value:** 30% faster sprint planning, better alignment, automatic sync.

## 3. Architecture Documentation

**Challenge:** Architecture docs get stale, live in wikis nobody reads.

**Miro Solution:**
```
Flow: System diagrams -> Technical specs -> Living documentation
```

**Implementation:**
1. Architects draw system diagrams in Miro
2. Add technical notes, decisions, constraints
3. Generate specs via Miro Specs or MCP
4. Embed board in Confluence/Notion
5. Update board as architecture evolves

**Value:** Always up-to-date architecture knowledge base, visual + textual.

## 4. Customer Journey Mapping

**Challenge:** Journey maps created in workshops but never actioned.

**Miro Solution:**
```
Flow: Touchpoints -> Pain points -> Opportunities -> Action items
```

**Implementation:**
1. Map customer journey with frames per stage
2. Cluster pain points and opportunities
3. Prioritize with voting and dot voting
4. Convert opportunities to cards/tasks
5. Sync to project management tools

**Value:** Cross-functional alignment on customer experience with actionable outcomes.

## 5. Workshop Facilitation

**Challenge:** Remote workshops lack the energy and output of in-person sessions.

**Miro Solution:**
```
Flow: Agenda frames -> Brainstorm stickies -> Vote -> Cluster -> Action items
```

**Implementation:**
1. Pre-build workshop structure with frames
2. Use templates (300+ available)
3. Facilitate with timer, voting, presenter mode
4. Cluster output with drag-and-drop
5. Convert stickies to action items

**Value:** Remote workshops as effective as in-person, with better documentation.

## 6. Knowledge Base

**Challenge:** Knowledge scattered across docs, wikis, slides with no visual context.

**Miro Solution:**
```
Flow: Visual documentation -> Board links -> Searchable content
```

**Implementation:**
1. Create visual documentation in Miro
2. Organize with nested frames and tags
3. Link related boards together
4. Embed in existing knowledge systems
5. Search across visual and textual content

**Value:** Single source of truth combining visual and written content.

## 7. Data Visualization

**Challenge:** Data locked in dashboards, not accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

**Miro Solution:**
```
Flow: External data -> Miro tables/diagrams -> Shared dashboards
```

**Implementation:**
1. Connect data sources via MCP or integrations
2. Populate tables with real-time data
3. Create visual dashboards on canvas
4. Add context with text and annotations
5. Share with stakeholders for discussion

**Value:** Make data accessible and discussable for all stakeholders.

## Industry-Specific Patterns

### Financial Services
- **Regulatory mapping** - Compliance requirements to controls
- **Risk visualization** - Risk registers with visual heat maps
- **Process documentation** - Auditable process flows

### Healthcare
- **Patient journey mapping** - Care pathways visualization
- **Clinical workflows** - Protocol documentation
- **Research collaboration** - Study design and analysis

### Technology
- **API design** - Visual API contracts
- **Microservices architecture** - Service dependency maps
- **Incident response** - Runbook visualization

### Manufacturing
- **Value stream mapping** - Lean process flows
- **Quality management** - Fishbone diagrams, 5 Whys
- **Facility planning** - Layout and flow optimization

### Consulting
- **Strategy frameworks** - Porter's Five Forces, SWOT, etc.
- **Client workshops** - Collaborative discovery sessions
- **Deliverable creation** - Visual reports and recommendations
